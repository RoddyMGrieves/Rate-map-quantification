# Rate map quantification
 Code used to generate, and quantify the accuracy of, two-dimensional firing rate maps.
 Used for the publication "Estimating neuronal firing density: a quantitative analysis of firing rate map algorithms"

 ## figures
 Code used to generate the main figures for the publication and carry out some of the analyses

 ## map_generation
 Code used to generate the place cells (spike data), generate firing rate maps with various settings, compare firing rate maps to the underlying spike density.

 ## random_walks
 Code used to generate the random walk (position data).

 ## ripley_k
 Code used as proof-of-concept for Ripley's K density metric.
